# Covid-X-ray
A project of CV Deep Learning model for Covid pneumonias Xray images classification.

IMPORTANT! All the conclusions from this project should undergo a thorough clinical study, so it is not possible to validate any conclusion without a valid clinical test.

This project intends to evaluate a deep learning model for classification of Xray images coming from various kinf of pneumonia included Covid-19

Is there a way for a deep learning computer vision model to tell the difference between various king of pneumonia by  Xray images?

In the file "Covid-project.pdf" you will find the report and all the steps i followed to train the model and achieve some conclusions.

In the folder "dataset_for_classification" you will find all images i used to train the model split by kind of pneumonia.
