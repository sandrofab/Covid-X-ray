# Covid-X-ray
A project of a **Computer Vision Deep Learning model** for **Covid-19** and pneumonias Xray images classification.

#### IMPORTANT! 
All the conclusions from this project should undergo a thorough clinical study, so it is not possible to validate any conclusion without a valid clinical test.

## The Project
This project has been developed in May 2020 and intends to evaluate a deep learning model for classification of Xray images coming from various kind of pneumonia included Covid-19.

Is there a way for a deep learning computer vision model to tell the difference between various king of pneumonia by  Xray images?

### How the project is structured
Here is a description of folders and files in this repository
* [dataset_for_classification](https://github.com/sandrofab/Covid-X-ray/tree/master/dataset_for_classification) - here you will find x-ray images split in 4 self explaining subfolders.
* [Scripts and Notebooks] - a folder with scripts and Colab noteboos with code udes for the pre-processing tasks and model training
* [Plots]


In the file [Covid-project-report.pdf](https://github.com/sandrofab/Covid-X-ray/edit/master/README.md) you will find the report and all the steps i followed to train the model and achieve some conclusions.
